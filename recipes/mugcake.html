        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>A mug cake like the name suggests is a cake that is most often made in a cup or mug then cooked in a microwave. These mini cakes can also be made using a ramekin and oven, but the idea is a quick and easy one serving treat that can be made in 5-10 minutes.</p>
