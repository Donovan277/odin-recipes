        <h3>What it is?</h3>
        <p>Focaccia is a (relatively) thin Italian bread that is characterized by its fluffy inside and tender thin crust. Before baking it is thoroughly covered in olive oil and then dipples are pressed into the dough to release gas and infuse the olive oil. Depending on what region you are in it might be topped with salt, herbs, vegetables, or even cheese.</p>
